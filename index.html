				<h3> My Favorite CMSC Subject: 127 </h3>
				<h4> It's my favorite because it was one of the few CMSC subjects that I was able to pick up quite easily even when I self studied it. I found it easier to make queries rather than code something from scratch.</h4>

				<h3> I'm a Junior studying BS Computer Science in UPLB </h3>
				<h4> I like all kinds of animals! Dogs, Cats, Hedgehogs, Pythons, but I absolutely hate and fear frogs! They're all slimey and make weird sounds. I'm very interested in illustation and any form of art. I have dabbled on painting, digital art, illustration, sketching and more!</h4>
